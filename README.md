# Observability Engineering Series

Code examples and practical implementations for the blog series **"Practical Observability with Python"**, based on concepts from the book *Observability Engineering* by Charity Majors, Liz Fong-Jones, and George Miranda.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- `uv` for dependency management

## Chapter 1: Structured Logging
*Status: Complete*

Moving from "grep-based debugging" to "query-based observability" using structured logging.

- **Location:** `chapters/ch1-structured-logging/`
- **Key Concepts:**
    - The limitations of standard text logs.
    - Implementing structured JSON logging with `loguru`.
    - Context binding for queryable logs.

For detailed usage instructions, including how to run the examples and configure environment variables, please refer to the [Chapter 1 README](chapters/ch1-structured-logging/README.md).

## Chapter 2: Context Propagation
